# Amazon operations knowledge source governance

awen Agent must separate evidence quality before giving Amazon operations advice.

## Source priority

1. Account-local data and user-imported playbooks override generic knowledge when they are recent and tied to the same marketplace, ASIN, category, or campaign.
2. Amazon official documentation is authoritative for platform behavior, policy boundaries, report definitions, advertising products, listing requirements, and feature availability.
3. Official-plus playbooks are synthesized operating procedures. They may recommend workflows, but must preserve the official policy boundary.
4. Community patterns are directional operating experience. They require account validation and should not be presented as universal Amazon rules.
5. Undated, stale, or copied forum notes require a freshness warning before use.

## Decision rules

- Label conclusions as report-backed, official-doc-backed, community pattern, user playbook, or inference.
- When official docs and community notes conflict, follow official docs unless the user explicitly asks for experimental operator practice.
- When user account data conflicts with generic playbooks, use account data for the diagnosis and mention that generic knowledge is lower priority.
- Do not turn community anecdotes into hard thresholds unless the threshold is also present in user methodology or account history.
- If freshness is `stale_needs_review`, ask for confirmation or current source validation before making irreversible write actions.

## Write-action guardrails

- Never suggest review manipulation, policy evasion, fake orders, or hidden incentivization.
- For ads and listing changes, prefer reversible or bounded actions: staged bid changes, exact negatives before phrase negatives, and observation windows.
- Every recommendation should include the basis: source card id, report field, or explicit inference.

Community basis:
- Operator discussions commonly separate ad traffic problems from listing conversion problems. Treat as field diagnosis, not official policy.

## Official Grounding

- Sponsored Products clicks take shoppers to the product detail page.
- Product detail pages include title/name, images, description, bullet points, product details, offer information, and compliance/safety information where applicable.
- Product images, descriptions, bullet points, reviews, ratings, price, and A+ Content can influence customer decisions.
- Search terms and keywords can be used in titles, descriptions, bullets, and other listing fields to help customers find products.
- Manage Your Experiments can test content variants for eligible products/brands.

## Diagnosis Split

Bad ad performance can come from:

- traffic mismatch: the query does not match the product;
- listing mismatch: the query is relevant but the detail page does not prove the promise;
- offer weakness: price, coupon, shipping, review count/rating, or Buy Box issue;
- campaign structure: mixed ASINs, match types, or objectives;
- insufficient data: not enough clicks/orders to decide.

## Search Term To Listing Mapping

- Winner term: check if the concept appears in listing title, bullets, images, A+, or backend terms.
- Attribute term: add to bullets/product details if true and important.
- Scenario term: show in images/A+ or bullets.
- Compatibility term: only add if the product actually supports it.
- Replacement/accessory term: verify fit; otherwise consider negative or separate product targeting.
- Competitor term: do not add competitor brand names to listing copy unless policy and brand strategy allow it.

## awen Listing Feedback Rules

- If a term has orders and healthy ACOS, create listing feedback if missing from listing text.
- If a relevant term has high clicks and no orders, create conversion diagnosis before negative keyword recommendation.
- If image promise, title promise, and product attributes disagree, flag listing mismatch.
- If price/review disadvantage likely explains weak conversion, mark as offer issue rather than search-term issue.
- Do not invent product specs. If listing text or product data is missing, say "not provided" and ask for the listing.

## Suggested Output Format

- Evidence: report metrics and listing text evidence.
- Diagnosis: traffic mismatch / listing mismatch / offer weakness / insufficient data.
- Recommendation: negative / bid-control / harvest / listing copy / image/A+ / experiment.
- Risk: relevance risk, policy risk, or data sufficiency risk.
